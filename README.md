# go-meta

A Go-first full-stack web framework. Phase 1 scope: file routing, server
rendering (templ), client rendering (Svelte 5 islands), layout ownership, and
soft navigation.

The implementation plan lives in [`phase1-implementation-blueprint.md`](phase1-implementation-blueprint.md).

## Visual layouts

Each page uses the nearest ancestor `layout.templ` or `layout.svelte`,
including one in its own directory. More distant layouts are not composed.
The framework supplies the HTML document independently. A templ layout may
wrap a templ or Svelte page; a Svelte layout supports Svelte pages. A templ
page under a Svelte layout is rejected because Svelte is client-only. Templ
layouts in dynamic `[parameter]` directories are also rejected because
their generated Go packages cannot use bracketed import paths. Two layout
files in the same directory are an error.

## Toolchain requirements

- **Go 1.26+** is required. The Fiber v3 documentation lists Go 1.26 as the
  minimum version; `go.mod` targets Go 1.26.
- **Node.js / npm** is allowed **only for development and build** (Vite, Svelte,
  TypeScript checks). It is never part of the production runtime: the server is
  a single Go binary serving pre-compiled assets from `dist/client`. Production
  must run with Node.js not installed on the host.

## Generated artifacts policy

## Development

Install Node.js and npm, run `npm ci`, install Air, and build the CLI with
`go build -o bin/meta ./cmd/meta`. Start the backend and Vite together with
`bin/meta dev`. Air regenerates routes and templates before backend builds;
Vite serves the existing frontend entry and Svelte HMR directly. No
`dist/client` build is needed in this mode.

The backend defaults to port 3000 (`PORT` overrides it). Vite binds only
`127.0.0.1:5173` (`GO_META_VITE_PORT` overrides the port) and fails if its
port is in use. The browser must run on the same machine and reach both
origins. Production continues to serve the built manifest and does not run
Node. A05 must provide a unified origin, including HTTP and WebSocket proxying
and an appropriate externally reachable host policy; A06 owns richer
diagnostics. Run the isolated real-browser development test with
`npm exec playwright -- test -c playwright.dev.config.ts`.

## Commands (from a clean checkout)

```bash
make generate   # templ codegen — must run before any go build
make build      # generate + go build + npm ci + vite build
make test       # generate + go vet/test + svelte-check + tsc --noEmit
make clean      # remove bin/ and dist/
```

Ordering contract: generation (`make generate`) always precedes Go compilation;
`make build` bundles the full pipeline. Production runs the Go binary and
serves pre-built `dist/client` assets — no Node on the runtime host.

## Status

Tasks A01–A08 of the Phase 1 task board are complete: repository bootstrapped,
the Go module initialized, Fiber v3 (pinned at v3.6.1) added with a
`GET /healthz` endpoint in `cmd/example`, recovery + request-logging middleware
installed, the frontend toolchain initialized (Vite 8 + Svelte 5 + TypeScript,
with `npm run check` via svelte-check), templ v0.3.1100 pinned as a Go
tool dependency (`go tool templ generate`; sample `app/page.templ` compiles
and renders HTML under test), and a Makefile orchestrating deterministic
generate/build/test/clean. Subsequent tasks (route discovery and generation)
are implemented sequentially per the blueprint's gates.

Gate 0 (runnable health endpoint, Svelte build, templ compile) is green.
