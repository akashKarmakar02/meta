# go-meta

A Go-first full-stack web framework. Phase 1 scope: file routing, server
rendering (templ), client rendering (Svelte 5 islands), layout ownership, and
soft navigation.

The implementation plan lives in [`phase1-implementation-blueprint.md`](phase1-implementation-blueprint.md).

## Visual layouts

Each page uses the nearest ancestor `layout.templ` or `layout.svelte`,
including one in its own directory. More distant layouts are not composed.
The framework supplies the HTML document independently. A templ layout may
wrap a templ or Svelte page; a Svelte layout supports Svelte pages. A templ
page under a Svelte layout is rejected because Svelte is client-only. Templ
layouts in dynamic `[parameter]` directories are also rejected because
their generated Go packages cannot use bracketed import paths. Two layout
files in the same directory are an error.

## Toolchain requirements

- **Go 1.26+** is required. The Fiber v3 documentation lists Go 1.26 as the
  minimum version; `go.mod` targets Go 1.26.
- **Node.js / npm** is allowed **only for development and build** (Vite, Svelte,
  TypeScript checks). It is never part of the production runtime: the server is
  a single Go binary serving pre-compiled assets from `dist/client`. Production
  must run with Node.js not installed on the host.

## Generated artifacts policy

## Commands (from a clean checkout)

```bash
make generate   # templ codegen — must run before any go build
make build      # generate + go build + npm ci + vite build
make test       # generate + go vet/test + svelte-check + tsc --noEmit
make clean      # remove bin/ and dist/
```

Ordering contract: generation (`make generate`) always precedes Go compilation;
`make build` bundles the full pipeline. Production runs the Go binary and
serves pre-built `dist/client` assets — no Node on the runtime host.

## Status

Tasks A01–A08 of the Phase 1 task board are complete: repository bootstrapped,
the Go module initialized, Fiber v3 (pinned at v3.6.1) added with a
`GET /healthz` endpoint in `cmd/example`, recovery + request-logging middleware
installed, the frontend toolchain initialized (Vite 8 + Svelte 5 + TypeScript,
with `npm run check` via svelte-check), templ v0.3.1100 pinned as a Go
tool dependency (`go tool templ generate`; sample `app/page.templ` compiles
and renders HTML under test), and a Makefile orchestrating deterministic
generate/build/test/clean. Subsequent tasks (route discovery and generation)
are implemented sequentially per the blueprint's gates.

Gate 0 (runnable health endpoint, Svelte build, templ compile) is green.
